# Fix the Broken Buttons: Save Business Owners From Financial Ruin

## The Real Problem
Business owners are losing sleep, crying at night, and watching their life's work crumble because of tax mistakes. They don't need badges or animations. They need to NOT GO TO JAIL and NOT LOSE THEIR HOMES.

## What They're Actually Crying For
- **"Am I going to prison?"** - Clear yes/no answer with exact risk level
- **"How much will I owe?"** - Exact penalty calculations, not estimates
- **"What do I do RIGHT NOW?"** - Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. No fluff.
- **"Which form do I need?"** - The exact form, pre-filled, ready to submit
- **"Can someone help me?"** - Real human who can file it for them

## Task 1: Make "Mark as Started" Actually Save Their Progress

### The Pain
They start fixing something, get interrupted by a customer, come back and have to start over. Meanwhile, the deadline is tomorrow.

### The Fix
```typescript
// Simple progress saving - no gamification BS
interface TaskProgress {
  taskId: string
  started: boolean
  completed: boolean
  lastSaved: Date
  nextStep: string // Exactly what to do next
  deadlineDate: Date
  penaltyIfMissed: number // Real money they'll lose
}
```

### Implementation
1. Click "Mark as Started" ‚Üí Saves to database
2. Shows "Started on [date] - [X] days until deadline"
3. Red banner if deadline is <7 days: "File by [date] or pay $[penalty]"
4. Auto-email reminder 48 hours before deadline

### Success = They Don't Miss Deadlines
- 0 missed deadlines = success
- Every missed deadline = we failed them

## Task 2: "View Details" = Show Me Exactly What To Do

### The Pain
They click "View Details" expecting help. Nothing happens. They panic more.

### The Fix

## Task 3: Form Downloads That Actually Work
